# CS-350

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project that was completed as the culmination of this term was that of a simulated thermostat. This device is able to pulse and hold LED lights based on the current temperature and whether the cooling or heating state maching cycles are on. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I was able to develop code that implemented functionality with minimal usage of space. This means that most commands and functions were able to be limited to only a few lines of code as a maximum. This is great because it helps code remain both simple and functional. This is critical when working on embedded systems.

#Where could you improve?
I would like to improve my understanding of the existing libraries used to imlement code commands.

#What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The primary tool that I use is online forumns to discuss my code with more experienced programmers. Such sources, like Stack Exchange and to some level Github, have empowered me to get unique feedback on my code and how industry standards apply.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The primary skill that I learned form this project was learning how state machines work with iterative processes. I also learned how to simplify code design for maximum efficiency.

#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
All code is notated thoroughly with commmon naming conventions used. Additionally, object oriented concepts are used to contain code within easily trasnferrable classes and methods.
